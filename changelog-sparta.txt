Version 0.9.7 19 April 2014

Checker Framework package renaming
1.  The environment variable CHECKERS should not be used. Instead use CHECKERFRAMEWORK and set it to checker-framework/

2. The lines to copy to an app's build file have changed.  The are listed in the manual.  Note that this means you'll have to change the build files for apps that previously used our tools.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.4 19 November 2013
Sample Apps
  Three new apps have been fully annotated as examples uses of the 
  Flow Checker.  

Flow Checker Changes
  A warning is issued if a flow policy contains a possible transitive flow

Version 0.9.3 1 August 2013

Flow Checker Changes
   Flow Checker now writes a file called missingAPI.astub that list all
   the methods that need to be annotated in a stub file.
   Stub file defaulting has changed.  See Section 3.5 Annotating methods in stub
   files in the manual for more details

More Flow Analysis
   The Flow Checker now creates summary files of flows found in the application.
   These flows can be filtered using the filter-flows ant target.
   Current flow files include:
       foundFlows.txt - A summary of found and forbidden flows
       forbiddenFlows.txt - A flow-policy consisting of forbidden flows
       forbiddenFlowLocations.txt - A machine searchable file of all flows in the system that
       can be indexed using filter-flows.

String Comparison
   Sparta now contains ant build targets and perl scripts for finding strings
   shared between multiple applications, which is useful for detecting collusion.
   String literals are first captured using capture-strings for each application.
   The captured strings are placed in sparta_strings.txt.  An application under
   analysis can be compared against other applications by using compare-strings.
   A root directory of where to search for sparta_strings.txt must be provided 
   by using the -Dcompare.root= command line parameter.

Dependent Permissions Checker
   Intents and URIs use different permissions depending on what they access. 
   Dependent Permissions checker tracks special string literals and
   string constants that will require some permission if used to in an Intent
   or URI.

RequiredPermission Changes
    A new annotation, @MayRequiredPermission, was added.  It is used to indicate 
    that a method method require a permission.  The notes field discribes when the
    permission may be required.

Unified Permissions Checker
   A unified permissions checker has been added that will run the Required 
   Permissions checker and the Dependent Permissions Checker. Users should now use
   ant check-permissions instead of reqperms.

Version 0.9.2 1 June 2013

Major Refactoring
   We did the following renamings: 
      ant target flow-test is now check-flow
      @FlowSources -> @Source
      @FlowSinks -> @Sink
      @PolyFlowSinks -> @PolySink
      @PolyFlowSources -> @PolySource
   Also, merged the FlowSource and FlowSink enums into FlowPermission
   all of the constants in the new enum are named to match Android 
   permissions.  This means that some of the old sources and sinks no 
   longer exist.  You can find a mapping from old to new in comments in
   SpartaPermission.

Version 0.9.0 22 April 2013

Stub Files
   flow.astub is now generated from files in 
   src/sparta/checkers/flowstubfile.  Annotations for Android and Java 
   class should go in the file name that corresponds with its package 
   name.

Version 0.8.1 3 April 2013

flow.astub
  Removed incorrect annotations

Permissions 
  permission.astub now uses the PScout Permission map for Android 
  version 4.0.1. (http://pscout.csl.toronto.edu) 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8.0, 1 March 2013

Policy Files
  Applications are now required to have flow policies describing 
  permitted flows. 

Default Types
  Literals are now typed with @Sources(SpartaPermission.LITERAL)
  Other changes to defaulting to reduce annotation burden

Version 0.7, 16 Oct 2012

Added more API annotations for Android and JDK libraries, in file flow.astub.
  Such annotations are necessary for any API that an app uses.  By
  expanding the SPARTA-provided set, the user has less work to do.
  flow.astub now contains over 1600 annotated methods (APIs).

Rewrote parts the SPARTA manual, notably Chapter 4, "Flow Checker".
  The description of the flow type system is clearer, with additional examples.
  Some material that was redundant with the Checker Framework manual has
  been replaced by a cross-reference to the Checker Framework manual, so
  that users can look just one place for authoritative information.
  Defaulting is more clearly explained.
  A new	chapter 5 details what an app developer is required to do in order
  to have the app approved.  For example, source code obfuscation is not
  permitted, and each warning suppression must be justified.

Use version 1.4.2 instead of 1.4.0 of the Checker Framework.
  SPARTA is built on the Checker Framework.  The detailed changes (mostly
  bug fixes and refactorings, but also a few new features) appear in
  the Checker Framework changelog at
  http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/changelog-checkers.txt
